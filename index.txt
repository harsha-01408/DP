There are N buildings in a line, each with a given height. Find the maximum length of a subsequence of buildings that first strictly increases and then strictly decreases (i.e., a bitonic subsequence with a single peak).

Input
The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
For each test case:
- A line with integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000).
- A line with N integers A1, A2, …, AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000) — the heights.

Output
For each test case, print a single line with the maximum possible length of such a subsequence.

Example
Input:
2
10
1 3 5 6 4 8 4 3 2 1
6
8 6 3 4 2 1

Output:
9
5

Explanation
Test 1: One optimal subsequence is 1 3 5 6 8 4 3 2 1 (length 9).
Test 2: One optimal subsequence is 8 6 4 2 1 (length 5).

Maximum Partition

You are given an array A of N integers (1-based indexing). You may split the array into any number K (K ≥ 1) of
contiguous partitions so that together they cover the whole array in order.

If the partition sums are P1, P2, …, PK, define the “special sum” of the partitioning as:
    P1 − P2 + P3 − P4 + … + (−1)^(K−1) · PK
(i.e., start with +, then alternate −, +, −, …).

Task
Choose a partitioning that maximizes the special sum and output that maximum value.

Notes
• Partitions must be contiguous and in order (no reordering of elements).
• 1-based indexing is assumed in any explanation.

Input Format
• The first line contains an integer N.
• The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN.

Output Format
• Print a single integer: the maximum achievable special sum.

Constraints
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
• −10^5 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6  for all i in [1, N]

Example
Input
5
-1 -2 3 2 9

Output
9

Explanation
One optimal partitioning is: [−1] | [−2, 3] | [2, 9]
Here, P1 = −1, P2 = (−2 + 3) = 1, P3 = (2 + 9) = 11
Special sum = P1 − P2 + P3 = (−1) − 1 + 11 = 9
