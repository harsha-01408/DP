There are N buildings in a line, each with a given height. Find the maximum length of a subsequence of buildings that first strictly increases and then strictly decreases (i.e., a bitonic subsequence with a single peak).

Input
The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
For each test case:
- A line with integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000).
- A line with N integers A1, A2, …, AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000) — the heights.

Output
For each test case, print a single line with the maximum possible length of such a subsequence.

Example
Input:
2
10
1 3 5 6 4 8 4 3 2 1
6
8 6 3 4 2 1

Output:
9
5

Explanation
Test 1: One optimal subsequence is 1 3 5 6 8 4 3 2 1 (length 9).
Test 2: One optimal subsequence is 8 6 4 2 1 (length 5).

Maximum Partition

You are given an array A of N integers (1-based indexing). You may split the array into any number K (K ≥ 1) of
contiguous partitions so that together they cover the whole array in order.

If the partition sums are P1, P2, …, PK, define the “special sum” of the partitioning as:
    P1 − P2 + P3 − P4 + … + (−1)^(K−1) · PK
(i.e., start with +, then alternate −, +, −, …).

Task
Choose a partitioning that maximizes the special sum and output that maximum value.

Notes
• Partitions must be contiguous and in order (no reordering of elements).
• 1-based indexing is assumed in any explanation.

Input Format
• The first line contains an integer N.
• The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN.

Output Format
• Print a single integer: the maximum achievable special sum.

Constraints
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
• −10^5 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^6  for all i in [1, N]

Example
Input
5
-1 -2 3 2 9

Output
9

Explanation
One optimal partitioning is: [−1] | [−2, 3] | [2, 9]
Here, P1 = −1, P2 = (−2 + 3) = 1, P3 = (2 + 9) = 11
Special sum = P1 − P2 + P3 = (−1) − 1 + 11 = 9

The Abandoned City

You have N houses in a straight line; house i contains coins[i] (all positive).
You may start at any house and walk only in one direction (left or right) without
changing direction, stopping at any house. While walking, you collect coins from
every house you pass (including start and stop).

Find the **shortest distance** you must walk to collect **at least T coins**.
(“Distance” = number of houses visited = length of that contiguous segment.)
If it’s impossible (total coins < T), return -1.

Example:
coins = [1,2,3,4,5], T = 7
Minimum houses = 2 (e.g., houses [3,4] → 3+4=7).

Maximum Strength After One Segment Swap

You are given two integer arrays A and B of equal length n. A superhero’s strength is 0 initially.
He will finally pick exactly ONE of the two arrays (after an optional operation described below)
and add up all elements of that chosen array — that total is his strength.

Before choosing the array, he may perform AT MOST ONE operation:
- Choose indices l and r (0 ≤ l ≤ r < n), and swap the subarray A[l..r] with B[l..r]
  (i.e., for every i in [l, r], swap A[i] and B[i]).

He can do this operation once or skip it. After that, he chooses either the resulting A or the
resulting B and his strength is the sum of all elements in that chosen array.

Task
Return the maximum possible strength he can obtain.

Input Format
- Line 1: integer n — length of the arrays.
- Line 2: n space-separated integers — A[0..n−1].
- Line 3: n space-separated integers — B[0..n−1].

Output Format
- A single integer: the maximum total obtainable after at most one subarray swap and then
  choosing the better of the two arrays.

Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤ 10^4
- A and B have the same length.

Sample Input
5
20 40 20 70 30
50 20 50 40 20

Sample Output
220

Explanation
Swap the segment l=3, r=4 (0-based):
A becomes [20, 40, 20, 40, 20]  → sum = 140
B becomes [50, 20, 50, 70, 30]  → sum = 220
Choose B; maximum strength = 220.

Interleaving Subsequences Count

Given three lowercase strings p, q, and r (length ≤ 100), count the number of ways to form
exactly the string r by interleaving a subsequence of p and a subsequence of q, while
preserving the relative order of characters taken from each string. You must use at least
one character from p and at least one character from q. Return the answer modulo 1,000,000,007.

Notes
- “Subsequence” means you may skip characters but cannot reorder them.
- The two chosen subsequences (one from p, one from q) are interleaved to form r.
- At least one character must be taken from each of p and q.

Input Format
- Line 1: string p
- Line 2: string q
- Line 3: string r

Output Format
- A single integer: the number of valid interleavings modulo 1,000,000,007.

Constraints
- 1 ≤ |p|, |q|, |r| ≤ 100
- All strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

Sample
p: ab
q: ba
r: aba

Output:
2

Explanation:
Two valid ways to form "aba":
1) take "a" from p, then "ba" from q
2) take "ab" from p, then "a" from q
