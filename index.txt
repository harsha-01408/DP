There are N buildings in a line, each with a given height. Find the maximum length of a subsequence of buildings that first strictly increases and then strictly decreases (i.e., a bitonic subsequence with a single peak).

Input
The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
For each test case:
- A line with integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000).
- A line with N integers A1, A2, …, AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000) — the heights.

Output
For each test case, print a single line with the maximum possible length of such a subsequence.

Example
Input:
2
10
1 3 5 6 4 8 4 3 2 1
6
8 6 3 4 2 1

Output:
9
5

Explanation
Test 1: One optimal subsequence is 1 3 5 6 8 4 3 2 1 (length 9).
Test 2: One optimal subsequence is 8 6 4 2 1 (length 5).
